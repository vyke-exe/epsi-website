# Welcome to the skies!

This is my home! I'm Epsi!

This place is a sanctuary for my thoughts, and a place to showcase new endeavours I take myself on! I implore you, my lovely guest, to stay awhile, read and view my works, and perhaps bookmark my humble abode!

My current interests include art, both drawing and pixel art, as well as music. I am learning guitar and hope to one day create music regularly! I have also fairly recently began working in security, so I will be highlighting my learning in this field.

Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy your stay here!
